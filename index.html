            <p>Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold":</p>
            <ul id="role-notes">
                <li>If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.</li>
                <li>If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.</li>
                <li> If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.</li>
                <li>The first player to score 100 or more points wins.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                For example, the first player, Donald, begins a turn with a roll of 5. Donald could hold and score 5 points, but chooses to roll again.
                Donald rolls a 2, and could hold with a turn total of 7 points, but chooses to roll again. Donald rolls a 1, and must end his turn without scoring.
                The next player, Alexis, rolls the sequence 4-5-3-5-6, after which she chooses to hold, and adds her turn total of 23 points to her score.
